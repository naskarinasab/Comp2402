    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
    <small>These questions involve choosing the right abstraction (Collection, Set, List, Queue, Deque, SortedSet, Map, or SortedMap) to efficiently accomplish the task at hand. The best way to do these is to read the question and then think about what type of Collection is best to use to solve it. There are only a few lines of code you need to write to solve each of them.</small>
